# Wildfire App

Welcome!
* To begin, you would need to clone this repository by running
```git clone https://github.com/reskillamericans/Wildfire-Group1.git```
on your local computer.

* Each feature you work on will be done in a separate branch. Each new branc should be named by the feature being worked on. You can use namings like "feature/newsLetter".
    To create a new branch, run ```git checkout -b branch_name``` (where branch_name is the name of the new branch being created.)
* Once you're done, pull from the remote *development* branch, by running ```git pull origin development```.
* Fix all merge conflicts that may arise
* Push your code to upstream by running
```git push origin -u branch_name```. 
* Now you can proceed to github to create a *pull request* to the *development* branch.
* Your pull request will be merged once it is verified not to have conflicts. 
*Please do not push directly to the main branch*

All the best!
